##### FAQ

Q: The software doesn't start after clicking the .exe file. What should I do?  
A: The default port 3000 may already be in use. Try changing the port number.   
   ShiguReader_Backend.exe --port 5000  

Q: Some videos cannot be played. What should I do?  
A: Videos are only a supplementary feature, and their supported formats are limited.

Q: The software works fine on my computer, but after scanning the QR code, it doesn't open on my phone. How can I resolve this?  
A: Please make sure that your computer and phone are connected to the same local Wi-Fi network. If it still doesn't open, check your computer's firewall settings.

Q: What does "ShiguReader" mean?  
A: ShiguReader is a combination of "Shigure" (しぐれ) and "Reader." The doujinshi of that era's Kantai Collection were really good.
