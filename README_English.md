##### Safety
ShiguReader is not safe when being accessed from the public IP. The server is not prepared for any cyber attack.

If you just want to read comic or watch anime when going outside, you can download the files to you tablet.
For example, my ipad has VLC for video and ComicGlass for comic. I download file in Chrome browser and save them to the apps.
